# Wisconsin-Standard-Bridge-Design-Tool
The gateway to the Bureau of Structures (BOS) standardized single span concrete slab bridge design program.

Standard Bridge Design Tool DoT Portal

Project Description:

As part of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation’s (WisDOT) efforts to reduce oversight, delivery and overall costs associated with the local Bridge Program; the Bureau of Structures (BOS) is developing standardized single span concrete slab bridge designs and plans for local bridges. As a part of this initiative, WisDOT was awarded a grant through the FHWA State Transportation Innovation Council (STIC) incentive program.

Concrete flat slab bridges represent a large percentage of the types of replacement bridges used on local road projects. An automated catalog of concrete flat slab bridge plans that offer a range of lengths, widths, and skews – amongst other bridge features – will provide an efficient means of creating plans with reduced overall structures design engineering cost. In turn, that reduction in delivery cost will be able to be reallocated within the program and will allow WisDOT to deliver more projects.

The standardized plans will provide a significant benefit in streamlining final design and drafting of concrete flat slab bridges. ​​The ​​bridge type, size and location (preliminary engineering), including hydraulics and a portion of the geotechnical analysis) will still be required to be completed by the designer.

My Role:
I was the primary back-end developer on this project focusing mainly on SQL Database access, usage and management through Oracle, Azure and other required SQL sources. In addition, I was responsible for most of the site's back-end behavior along with handling authentication systems and file interactions regarding its IIS Gateway resources. 

External to my direct work on the application, I also developed a Windows Scheduled Task to poll the applicable Standard Plans database servers with the goal of updating and maintaining them on a regular basis while also providing the Wisconsin Bureau of Structures with detailed logs of user behavior and access.
